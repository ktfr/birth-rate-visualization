# Birth Rate Predictor
Python script utilizing Turtle graphics module to visualize and predict user-inputted data points representing birth rates.


## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Generates a clear visualization of birth rates from given data points.
- **Interpolation**: Estimates birth rates using simple linear interpolation calculation.
- **Error-handling**: Ensures manual data points inputted by user is within range and satisfies conditions. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run main.py
2. Determine how many data points will be used for the calculations.
4. When asked for the x coordinate, enter year of data entry.
5. When asked for y coordinate, enter birth rate.
6. Continue process until all data points indicated in step 1 is complete. The program then asks the user to enter two years they want to use to interpolate as integers.
7. Select start and end date for data interpolation. If data is not in range, the program will return an error.
